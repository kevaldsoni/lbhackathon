Help At Hand is a mobile application that aims at helping users when help is required.
A user may press the "Help" button (from the notifications bar) whenever they feel insecure at a new place.
The nearest registered users to the app are notified along with the directions of the victim.
The app can be updated to inform the police control room of the victim's location as well.
